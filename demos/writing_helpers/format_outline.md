## Text to Format

Our project involves several stages. First, we need to define the key objectives and gather initial requirements from stakeholders. Once that is done, we will move into the design phase, where wireframes and prototypes will be created. The development phase will follow, where the actual code will be written based on the design specifications. After development, testing will be conducted to ensure everything works correctly. Finally, the deployment phase will roll out the finished product to end users.
