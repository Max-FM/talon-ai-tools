Of this, $50,000 is allocated for software development, $30,000 for marketing, and $20,000 for quality assurance. The remaining $100,000 will be reserved for contingency and operational costs. It’s critical to monitor expenditures closely to ensure we don’t exceed the allotted budget in any area.Team Structure: We will have a dedicated team for the project, consisting of 5 developers, 2 QA testers, and 3 marketing professionals.
