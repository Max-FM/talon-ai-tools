## Command to Use

`model check structure`

## Description

This command checks the structure and layout of the provided text and evaluates whether the structure is correct and the flow is logical. If the structure or order is incorrect, it will return feedback on what might be wrong. If it is all correct, it will say it looks good.

## Text to Check

Introduction: Our company has seen significant growth over the last year.
The expansion into new markets was successful, though there were challenges in the Asia region. However, new technologies implemented in Europe improved efficiency.

Conclusion: Looking ahead, we expect continued growth with a focus on the American market.

Body: Some challenges we faced this year included supply chain disruptions and workforce shortages, particularly in North America. Despite this, profitability increased by 10%.

## Example Output

The structure and order of your writing are not correct. Typically, the body of a text should come before the introduction and conclusion. Consider rearranging it to present the body first, followed by the introduction, and then the conclusion. This will enhance the flow and coherence of your writing.
