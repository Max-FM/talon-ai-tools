## Command to Use

`model check grammar`

## Description

## Text to Check

Their going to the store later today and I’m not sure weather they’ll be back in time for the meeting. Could of asked them earlier but I was busy with something else.

## Example Output

1. "Their" should be "They're" (contraction of "they are").
2. "weather" should be "whether" (used to express a choice).
3. "Could of" should be "Could have" (incorrect form).
4. The sentence could be split for clarity: "I could have asked them earlier, but I was busy with something else." (Adding a comma before "but" improves readability).
