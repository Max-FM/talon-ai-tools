# Grammar Fixing Demo

Open this file in a text editor, highlight the text to be fixed, and use the below Talon commands to see the fixes in action.

## Commands to Use

`model fix grammar` or `model fix grammar formally`

## Description

These commands correct mistakes in grammar, spelling, and formatting. The `fix grammar` option performs corrections but maintains the original tone of the text. For `fix grammar formally`, the text is refined into a formal business tone while addressing homophones and misrecognitions common in voice dictation without changing the original structure.

## Example Output

I had gone to the meeting yesterday, and I was really surprised by how unprepared everyone was. There was a lot of confusion about the presentation slides and the agenda for the day. I thought we had everything sorted out in the email thread last week, but apparently not everyone had been copied on the final version. It's really important that moving forward, we make sure everyone’s on the same page before the meeting starts. Otherwise, it causes a lot of unnecessary delays and frustrations. After the meeting, I talked to a few colleagues who also noticed the lack of preparation, and we agreed that we need to improve our process. Hopefully by next week, we’ll have a better workflow in place, and this won’t be an issue again.
